- Proposed EMAT, an End-to-end Multi-view Association Tracker for multi-object tracking, which jointly performed 3D detection and tracking from multi-camera and multi-frame images
- Achieved the best performance of camera-based 3D tracking performance for about 0.49 in AMOTA and compared favorablywith the state-of-the-art 3D detection methods like BEVFormer and DETR3D
- Proficient in software development methodologies, including Git and Git Flow, for version control, collaborative coding, and efficient workflow management
